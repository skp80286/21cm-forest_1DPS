# 21cm-forest_1DPS
Codes to model the 21-cm forest signal and computate the 21-cm forest 1D power spectrum

<br /> 

Codes include:

Plotting 21-cm forest spectra

Incorporating instrumental features such as spectral resolution, Gaussian white noise

Computation of 21-cm forest power spectra (P21) and noise on them

Bayesian estimation of parameters - mean xHI, log(fX) from P21

Only some datasets or datasets reduced in size which used for Šoltinský et al. in prep are present in this repository due to the filesize limitations.
If you are interested in more data from this work, please request it from me by email.
