# 21cm-forest_1DPS
Codes to model the 21-cm forest signal and computate the 21-cm forest 1D power spectrum

<br /> 

Codes include:

Plotting 21-cm forest spectra

Incorporating instrumental features such as spectral resolution, Gaussian white noise

Computation of 21-cm forest power spectra (P21) and noise on them

Bayesian estimation of parameters - mean xHI, log(fX) from P21
